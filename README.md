# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Description
What you should learn from this project:

* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm

### [0. Bubble sort](./0-bubble_sort.c)
* Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm   



### [1. Insertion sort](./1-insertion_sort_list.c)
* Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm



### [2. Selection sort](./2-selection_sort.c)
* Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm


### [3. Quick sort](./3-quick_sort.c)
* Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm


### [4. Shell sort - Knuth Sequence](./100-shell_sort.c)
* Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Shell sort algorithm, using the Knuth sequence
